# speedTest
SpeedTest and Visualisation

A community connector that displys content from a CSV-file in DataStudio. The data comes from measuring download speed (speedTest.sh). 
Currently the connector only supports three columns with a fix name. It's main purpose is to show how to connect to a CSv-file and use it's content inside DataStudio.
